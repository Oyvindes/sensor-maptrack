# Power Sensor Module Refactoring

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring of the power sensor functionality in the application. The refactoring was performed to improve code organization, maintainability, and type safety while preserving all existing functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Type Safety

- Created dedicated type definitions in `src/types/powerSensors.ts`
- Replaced generic `SensorData` types with specific `PowerSensor` types
- Added proper type interfaces for all power-related data structures

### 2. Centralized Configuration

- Created a configuration module in `src/config/powerSensorConfig.ts`
- Moved hardcoded values (refresh intervals, API endpoints, etc.) to the configuration
- Standardized naming conventions for constants

### 3. Custom Hooks

- Created custom hooks to encapsulate power sensor logic:
  - `usePowerSensor`: Manages power sensor status and control
  - `usePowerConsumption`: Manages power consumption data
  - `usePowerSensors`: Manages power sensor listing, adding, editing, and deleting

### 4. Component Refactoring

- Refactored power-related components to use the custom hooks:
  - `PowerControl`: Uses `usePowerSensor` for power control
  - `PowerDashboardButton`: Uses `usePowerSensor` for power toggling
  - `PowerConsumptionChart`: Uses `usePowerConsumption` for consumption data
  - `PowerSensorDashboard`: Uses `usePowerSensors` for sensor management

### 5. Adapter Pattern

- Implemented adapter functions in `src/services/sensor/powerSensorAdapter.ts`
- Created conversion functions between `SensorData` and `PowerSensor` types
- Added wrapper components to maintain backward compatibility

## Architecture Changes

### Before

```
Components
  ↓
Services
  ↓
Database
```

- Components directly called services
- Mixed UI and business logic
- Duplicate code across components
- Inconsistent error handling

### After

```
Components
  ↓
Custom Hooks
  ↓
Services + Adapters
  ↓
Database
```

- Components use custom hooks
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable logic
- Consistent error handling

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is now more modular and easier to maintain
2. **Better Type Safety**: Specific types reduce the risk of type-related bugs
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Common logic is now in reusable hooks
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error handling
5. **Better Testability**: Logic is separated from UI, making it easier to test

## Migration Path

The refactoring was done in a way that maintains backward compatibility:

1. Created new types and hooks
2. Refactored components to use the new hooks
3. Added adapter functions and wrapper components for backward compatibility
4. Updated existing components to use the wrapper components

This approach ensures that the application continues to function correctly while improving the code quality.

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete Service Refactoring**: Refactor the `powerSensorService.ts` to use the new types
2. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for the custom hooks and adapter functions
3. **Error Boundary**: Add error boundaries to handle unexpected errors
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize data fetching and caching
5. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all functions and components
