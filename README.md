## How to connect and send data from sensors

This application includes a built-in MQTT service that allows you to connect to and receive data from IoT sensors in real-time. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use this functionality.

### 1. Understanding the MQTT Service

The application provides a complete MQTT client service that handles:
- Connecting to an MQTT broker
- Subscribing to topics
- Publishing messages
- Receiving real-time updates from sensors

### 2. Connecting to the MQTT Broker

By default, the application uses a public MQTT broker at `mqtt://broker.emqx.io:1883`. You can connect to it programmatically:

```typescript
import { connectToBroker, disconnectFromBroker } from '@/services/sensorService';

// Connect to the default broker
await connectToBroker();

// Or connect to a custom broker with options
await connectToBroker('mqtt://your-broker-url:port', {
  username: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  clientId: 'custom-client-id'
});

// Disconnect when done
await disconnectFromBroker();
```

### 3. Using Node-RED with MQTT to Send Sensor Data

You can use Node-RED as the MQTT client to send data to your sensors in this application. Here's how to set it up:

#### Setting up a Node-RED Flow:

1. **Install Node-RED** if you haven't already: [Node-RED Installation Guide](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

2. **Add MQTT nodes** to your Node-RED instance:
   - In Node-RED, go to the menu (top right) > Manage palette
   - Go to the "Install" tab
   - Search for "node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker" and install it

3. **Configure an MQTT node:**
   - Drag an MQTT output node onto your workflow
   - Double-click to configure it
   - Set the broker to `broker.emqx.io` with port `1883` (or your custom broker)
   - Set the topic to match the sensor format: `briks/sensors/[sensorId]/data`

4. **Create a payload with the expected format:**
   - Add a function node before the MQTT node
   - Configure it to output a properly formatted JSON payload:

```javascript
// Example Node-RED function node code
msg.payload = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  values: [
    {
      type: "temperature",
      value: 25.4,
      unit: "째C"
    },
    {
      type: "humidity",
      value: 68,
      unit: "%"
    }
  ]
};
return msg;
```

5. **Deploy your Node-RED flow** and trigger it to send data to your sensors

#### Example Node-RED Flow:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "trigger-node",
    "type": "inject",
    "name": "Trigger every 5s",
    "topic": "",
    "payload": "",
    "repeat": "5",
    "crontab": "",
    "once": false
  },
  {
    "id": "prepare-sensor-data",
    "type": "function",
    "name": "Format Sensor Data",
    "func": "msg.payload = {\n    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\n    values: [\n        {\n            type: \"temperature\",\n            value: 20 + Math.random() * 10,\n            unit: \"째C\"\n        },\n        {\n            type: \"humidity\",\n            value: Math.round(60 + Math.random() * 20),\n            unit: \"%\"\n        }\n    ]\n};\nreturn msg;",
    "outputs": 1
  },
  {
    "id": "mqtt-out",
    "type": "mqtt out",
    "name": "Send to Sensor",
    "topic": "briks/sensors/sensor-001/data",
    "broker": "broker"
  },
  {
    "id": "broker",
    "type": "mqtt-broker",
    "name": "Public Broker",
    "broker": "broker.emqx.io",
    "port": "1883"
  },
  {
    "id": "connections",
    "wires": [
      ["trigger-node", "prepare-sensor-data"],
      ["prepare-sensor-data", "mqtt-out"]
    ]
  }
]
```

### 4. Sending Data to Update Sensors

To update a sensor's data via MQTT, publish a message to the sensor's topic:

```typescript
import { publishMessage, getSensorTopic } from '@/services/sensorService';

// Get the topic for a specific sensor
const topic = `briks/sensors/${sensorId}/data`;

// Create a payload with sensor values
const payload = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  values: [
    {
      type: "temperature",
      value: 25.4,
      unit: "째C"
    },
    {
      type: "humidity",
      value: 68,
      unit: "%"
    }
  ]
};

// Publish the message
await publishMessage(topic, payload);
```

### 5. Sending Commands to Sensors

You can also send commands to sensors:

```typescript
import { sendMqttCommandToSensor } from '@/services/sensorService';

// Send a command to a sensor
await sendMqttCommandToSensor(
  "sensor-001",  // sensor ID 
  "set_interval", // command name
  { interval: 5000 } // optional parameters
);
```

### 6. Registering for Sensor Updates

To receive real-time updates from sensors:

```typescript
import { registerForSensorUpdates } from '@/services/sensorService';

// Get a sensor object (with at least an id property)
const sensor = { id: "sensor-001", name: "My Sensor" };

// Register for updates
const cleanup = registerForSensorUpdates(sensor, (topic, payload) => {
  console.log(`Received data from ${sensor.name}:`, payload);
  // Update your UI with the new data
});

// Call the cleanup function when you no longer need updates
// cleanup();
```

### 7. Test with MQTT Explorer or Mosquitto

You can use tools like MQTT Explorer or Mosquitto clients to test sending data to your application:

1. Connect to the same broker (e.g., `mqtt://broker.emqx.io:1883`)
2. Publish a message to a sensor topic (e.g., `briks/sensors/sensor-001/data`)
3. Use JSON format for the message payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T12:34:56Z",
  "values": [
    {
      "type": "temperature",
      "value": 22.5,
      "unit": "째C"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 8. Example: Complete MQTT Workflow

Here's a complete example of how to use the MQTT service in your application:

```typescript
import { 
  connectToBroker, 
  disconnectFromBroker, 
  registerForSensorUpdates,
  sendMqttCommandToSensor
} from '@/services/sensorService';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function SensorMonitor() {
  const [isConnected, setIsConnected] = useState(false);
  const [sensorData, setSensorData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Connect to MQTT broker when component mounts
    const setup = async () => {
      const connected = await connectToBroker();
      setIsConnected(connected);
      
      if (connected) {
        const sensor = { id: "sensor-001", name: "Sensor 1" };
        // Register for updates
        const cleanup = registerForSensorUpdates(sensor, (topic, data) => {
          setSensorData(data);
        });
        
        // Return cleanup function
        return cleanup;
      }
    };
    
    const cleanupFn = setup();
    
    // Disconnect when component unmounts
    return () => {
      if (cleanupFn) cleanupFn();
      disconnectFromBroker();
    };
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Connection status: {isConnected ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}</div>
      {sensorData && <div>Latest data: {JSON.stringify(sensorData)}</div>}
      <button onClick={() => sendMqttCommandToSensor('sensor-001', 'refresh')}>
        Refresh Sensor
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
